# Shell based interactive chatGPT

## Introduction
- This is a simple interactive chatbot with chatGPT inside.
- We can change it's core and conversation with history in it's mind.
- I've combined it's function to a command, so we can use very easily.

## Installation
    
    ### step1
    open chatnow, chatloop.sh and chatnow_mainbody.sh, change the path to current path, open config.txt, delete the first line and change it to your own api-key
    for ex:
    
    vim chatnow
    

    ### step2
    
    git clone xxx
    cd ./chatnow
    sudo ./install.sh 
    

    
    


# Enjoy your chat
